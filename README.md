Katana Master Sword is a small game I made to know the Godot engine and GDScript. Android phone is the primary platform to run it but it can also be played on Windows desktop.

## Gameplay

The main character moves on rails from one enemy to another and then starts the duel. The goal is to swipe the enemy without touching his sword otherwise he ripostes.

Additionally, the player can try to find all collectibles in the background (available only on the highest difficulty) to open the secret ending.
